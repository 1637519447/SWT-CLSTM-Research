Statistical Significance Analysis Report for SWT-CLSTM Model

This study conducted rigorous statistical significance evaluation of the SWT-CLSTM model against five baseline models (LSTM, ARIMA, TFC, PatchTST, TimeMixerPlusPlus) on CPU and memory utilization prediction tasks through paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The experiments employed two real-world datasets, Alibaba_30s and Google_5m, with mean squared error (MSE) as the evaluation metric for pairwise model comparisons. Statistical test results demonstrate that the SWT-CLSTM model exhibits significant performance superiority across all testing scenarios. For CPU prediction tasks on the Alibaba_30s dataset, SWT-CLSTM achieved t-statistics of 5.219, 6.302, 17.635, 6.035, and 8.632 compared to LSTM, ARIMA, TFC, PatchTST, and TimeMixerPlusPlus models respectively, with corresponding p-values all below 0.001 (p<0.001), reaching extremely significant levels. Cohen's d effect size analysis reveals that the effect size between SWT-CLSTM and TFC model reaches 0.779, falling within the large effect range, while effect sizes with other models range from 0.23-0.38, indicating moderate to large practical differences. In memory prediction tasks, SWT-CLSTM's superiority is even more pronounced, particularly on the Alibaba_30s dataset where the comparison with PatchTST model yields a t-statistic of 23.766 (p<0.001) and Cohen's d effect size of 1.050, indicating extremely large practical differences. Mean error comparisons show that SWT-CLSTM achieves a CPU prediction error of only 2.315×10^-5 on the Alibaba_30s dataset, while other models exhibit errors ranging from 9.271×10^-5 to 6.820×10^-4, representing performance improvements of 300%-2845%. For memory prediction, SWT-CLSTM's mean error is 4.721×10^-7, achieving significant performance improvements of 233%-12026% compared to other models. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, as non-parametric statistical methods, further validate the robustness of these results, with all comparison p-values below 0.05, confirming that the statistical significance of SWT-CLSTM's performance advantages does not depend on distributional assumptions. Comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the SWT-CLSTM model possesses statistically significant superiority in resource utilization prediction tasks within cloud computing environments, providing reliable theoretical foundation for practical deployment.
